DESCRIPTION: 

Banking system is a general software developed to perform the various transactions in any bank.  This application was designed for two kinds of users. They are; the branch managers and the bank employees. Each user is assigned a unique employee ID and password using which they can log on to their respective accounts. Once the account is created, the user may change their password. A bank employee can perform various activities some of which include creating a new account for the customer, sanctioning  loan, processing transactions, closing accounts of the customer etc. Likewise, a bank manager can perform activities such as hiring an employee, viewing  details of employees and customers, viewing branch statistics, dismissing an employee etc. This application provides a very easy and interactive user interface. Each window has an help option to assist the user to perform the respective actions.
